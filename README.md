# MaxClique

Generated data are stored in `data/` directory while the `examples/` directory contains some graphs for experiments. 
Inside, the `200` is the number of nodes and the decimals `0.01,0.1,0.5` are density parameters.

Currently, the graphs in `examples/200/` have been solved using `max_clique()` function (an approximate algorithm provided by `networkx` package). 
Results are saved in `examples/200/max_cliques.csv`.
