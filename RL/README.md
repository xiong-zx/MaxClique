# Decomposition Algorithms for Scalable Quantum Annealing (DASQA)
Exact graph decomposition algorithms for MaxClique and Minimum Vertex Cover problems. The aim of this project is to create graph decomposition algorithms for specific problems, which generate sub-problems that are small enough to be able to be solved on modern quantum annealers. 

```DBK``` in ```DBK.py``` performs graph decomposition for the Maximum Clique problem. 

```DBR``` in ```DBR.py``` performs graph decomposition for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem. 

Each of these functions use a user specified solver function. In order to validate the correctness of the algorithm, we can use an exact solver function. The purpose of these algorithms is to use a quantum annealer as the solver. 

```validate_DBK.py``` imports DBK and validates the algorithm using the exact solver provided in the ```networkx``` package

```validate_DBR.py``` does the same except with DBR
